# Ezreal Clone

## About
This app is a partial clone based on the gameplay of [Ezreal](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/ezreal/) from [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) by [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/en). I developed it as a side project during my APCS class after an Asteroids clone assignment, which I used as starter code.

## Features
### Controls
- Move by clicking (any mouse button)
- Click dummy (pentagon) to select as target and start attacking if in range
- **q**: Cast Mystic Shot
- **e**: Cast Arcane Shift
- **d** or **f**: Cast Flash
- **a** or **x**: Attack move
- **s**: Stop moving

### Other
- Attack speed is set to 1.2 attacks/s
- Cast times are 0.25 s
- q + flash should work the same as it does in League
- e + flash does not work properly if they are cast in different directions

## Notes
- This was developed with [Processing 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331105213/https://processing.org/), which is now  [Processing](https://processing.org/), and I have not tested if the original code is compatible.
- The original app had sound effects, which I was unable to include when modifying the code for HTML embedding compatibility.
